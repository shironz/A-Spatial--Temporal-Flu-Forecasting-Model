This is a course project that we develop a spatical-temporal forecasting model to predict the flu in U.S. For the requirements about this project, please see "Project1.pdf".


1, We first develop a simulation experiments to show that our method could recove the true parameters, the codes are in "simulation.r".

2, We then apply the codes to the real data. The cleaned data are in folder "data", in which "w.txt" is the adjacent matrix for U.S. states. All the applications with real data are contained in "flu-predict".

3, Finally, after geting the MCMC chain, we use codes "outcome6.r" to summarize the estimates and also predict the number of flu for one year.

4, We report our outcomes in "MATH8820_Project1.pdf".
